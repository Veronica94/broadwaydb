  "body": "# Broadway (and Off-Broadway) Musical Analysis\r\nThe goal of this project is to better understand the measurable\r\ncharacteristics of musicals, and the patterns that emerge among different\r\ntypes of shows.\r\n\r\n# Table of Contents\r\n* [Blog Posts](#blog-posts)\r\n* [Source](#source)\r\n* [Developers](#developers)\r\n* [Background](#background)\r\n* [Data Collection](#data-collection)\r\n\r\n# Blog Posts\r\n* [A Statistical Analysis of Broadway (and Off-Broadway) Musicals](http://willwest.nyc/a-statistical-analysis-of-broadway-and-off-broadway-musicals.html)\r\n\r\n# Source\r\nThis project currently consists of three modules:\r\n* `crawl`: code for scraping lyrics and accessing APIs\r\n* `munge`: scripts for formatting and joining data\r\n* `analysis`: R code for data exploration\r\n\r\n# Developers\r\n* \"Will West\" wmw71190@gmail.com\r\n\r\n# Data Collection\r\nFor this project, several types of data are needed. First, lyrics are needed\r\nto capture the topics and lexical characteristics of each song and show.\r\nMetadata about each show and song is also necessary, so we can model the\r\npatterns that emerge between different composers and artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nWhile there has been a lot of work done in analyzing music in\r\ngeneral, often musicals are lumped into the soundtrack category without \r\nspecific attention given to their unique characteristics. This results in \r\nrecommendation systems and music discovery applications that don't properly\r\ncapture a user's tastes when it comes to musicals.\r\n\r\n## What makes musicals unique?\r\n\r\n### Subject matter\r\nMusicals tend to delve heavily into one or more topics that may set it apart\r\nfrom other musicals. While lyrics in traditional genres may address specific\r\nemotions (love, anger, etc.) or cultures (pop culture, politics, etc.),\r\na musical can revolve completely around a single topic. Take for example\r\nthe popular broadway musical Next to Normal. The entire musical is focused\r\non mental health, treatments, and the way both can positively and negatively\r\nimpact a family.\r\n\r\n### Composer, Lyricist, Artist Loyalties/Preferences\r\nWhile traditionally albums are composed and performed by a single artist, \r\nmusicals often are composed by a single composer and performed by several\r\ndifferent artists. A listener's opinion of a musical album may be impacted\r\nby both an affinity towards the composer/lyricist, and a mixture of\r\npreferences for each artist featured on the album.",
